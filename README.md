This is a demo repository for showing how to make lasagna.

## Ingredients

- 1 pound lean ground beef
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 jar (24 ounces) marinara sauce
- 1 cup water
- 1 package (16 ounces) lasagna noodles, uncooked
- 1 container (15 ounces) ricotta cheese
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook beef, onion and garlic, breaking up meat with a spatula, until browned, about 15 minutes. Drain excess fat. Stir in marinara sauce and water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.
2. In a medium bowl, stir together ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, salt, pepper and parsley.
3. In a 13x9 inch baking dish, spread 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce. Arrange 4 noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce over the cheese layer. Repeat with 4 more noodles, the remaining cheese mixture and 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce. Top with the remaining 4 noodles and the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese.
4. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake for 10 more minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna stand for 10 minutes before serving.
